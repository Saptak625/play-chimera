        Each card's features include:
        - Suit (0-3)
        - Rank (0-12)
        - Location (0=unknown, 1=in hand, 2=in current trick, 3=already played)

        - Legal (1 if the card is legal to play, 0 otherwise)
    - "global": A tensor containing global features about the current game state.
        Each feature is encoded as an integer:
        - Trump suit (0-3)
        - Trick position (0-3)
        - Lead suit (0-3, with 4 representing no lead suit)

        - Count in widow (number of cards in the widow, normalized by 5)
        - Void (4 values representing whether each player is void in each suit for each player, 0 or 1). 
          A player could be void in a suit, but other players might not know that yet, so this is based on the current player's knowledge of voids.
